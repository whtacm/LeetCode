/**
 * Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.
 * <p>
 * The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the
 * square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed
 * to be a positive integer.
 * <p>
 * You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces,
 * square brackets are well-formed, etc.
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any
 * digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example,
 * there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].
 * <p>
 * Examples: <br>
 * s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".<br>
 * s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".<br>
 * s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".<br>
